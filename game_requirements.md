# 3D Shooter Game Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and specifications for our 3D shooter game built with Three.js and Vite.

## Game Overview

**Working Title:** "Cosmic Defender 3D"

**Game Concept:** A first-person shooter game set in a sci-fi universe where players must defend against an alien invasion. The game takes place across various environments including a futuristic city, a space station, and eventually the alien homeworld. The gameplay is inspired by the classic Space Invaders arcade game from 1978, reimagined in 3D with modern graphics and mechanics.

**Setting/Theme:** Sci-fi with alien invasion storyline. The game will feature futuristic technology, alien creatures, and environments ranging from human settlements to alien landscapes.

**Player Experience:** Single-player focused experience with a campaign mode that tells the story of humanity's defense against the alien threat.

**Main Objective:** Survival-based gameplay where players must last as long as possible against increasingly difficult waves of alien invaders. Similar to Space Invaders, the aliens will attack in formation, gradually descending toward the player while the player must eliminate them before they reach the bottom/player position.

**Questions to clarify:**
- ✓ What is the setting/theme of the game? (Sci-fi, military, fantasy, etc.)
- ✓ Is this a single-player or multiplayer game?
- ✓ What is the main objective of the game? (Survival, completing missions, defeating bosses, etc.)

## Game Style and Aesthetics

**Visual Style:** Stylized with exaggerated proportions and vibrant colors. The game will feature bold, eye-catching visuals rather than realistic graphics. Aliens, weapons, and environments will have distinctive silhouettes and color schemes to ensure clear visual communication to the player.

**Art Direction:** The art style will draw inspiration from classic arcade games like Space Invaders but with a modern 3D twist. Environments will be colorful and slightly surreal, with strong contrasts and glowing elements. Alien designs will be distinctive and memorable, with each type having a unique silhouette and color scheme.

**Color Palette:** 
- Primary: Neon blues, purples, and greens for alien elements
- Secondary: Warm oranges and reds for human technology and weapons
- Accent: Bright yellows and whites for important gameplay elements and effects
- Dark space backgrounds with vibrant star fields and nebulae

**Asset Approach:** We will use a mix of open-source assets and custom-created simple models. For development efficiency, we'll start with available free assets and modify them to fit our stylized aesthetic.

- ✓ Are we using custom 3D models or pre-made assets?

## Core Gameplay Loop

**Main Loop:** Survive waves of aliens → Earn points/upgrades → Face stronger/new alien types → Repeat until overwhelmed

**Gameplay Approach:** Arena-style combat where aliens attack from multiple directions. The player will be positioned in a defensive area (like a bunker, platform, or defense station) with 360° movement and shooting capabilities. Unlike the original Space Invaders' 2D lateral movement, players will need to constantly scan their surroundings and prioritize threats coming from different directions.

**Wave Structure:**
1. Wave announcement/brief preparation time
2. Aliens spawn at the perimeter and advance toward the player in formations
3. Player eliminates aliens while managing resources (ammo, shields, etc.)
4. Wave completion rewards (weapon upgrades, health restoration, etc.)
5. Brief respite before the next, more difficult wave begins

**Progression System:**
- Wave-based progression with increasing difficulty
- Each wave introduces new enemy types or more challenging formations
- Higher waves feature faster, stronger, or more numerous enemies
- Special "elite" enemies appear in later waves with unique attack patterns
- Boss waves at milestone intervals (every 5 or 10 waves) featuring large, powerful alien commanders

**Upgrade Mechanics:**
- Specific enemy types drop special upgrades when defeated
- Shield upgrades: Defeating blue shield-carrier aliens grants shield segments
- Weapon upgrades: Defeating red weapon-carrier aliens grants weapon enhancements
- Shields can absorb a limited number of hits before breaking
- Players can have multiple shield segments active simultaneously
- Destroyed shields can be replenished by defeating more shield-carrier aliens
- Weapon upgrades stack and include: increased damage, fire rate, special ammo types

**Scoring System:**
- Points awarded for each alien destroyed
- Bonus points for accuracy, headshots, or combo kills
- Multipliers for consecutive hits or eliminating specific formations
- High score tracking to encourage replayability

**Player Engagement:**
- Classic arcade-style high score leaderboard
- Players can enter their three-letter initials when achieving a high score
- Local leaderboard stores the top 10 scores
- Leaderboard displays player name, score, and highest wave reached
- Special visual and audio effects for achieving a new high score
- End-of-game stats screen showing performance metrics (accuracy, aliens destroyed, etc.)
- "One more try" quick restart option to encourage continued play

**Questions to clarify:**
- ✓ What is the main activity players will be doing?
- ✓ How does progression work in the game?
- ✓ What keeps players engaged and coming back?

## Player Mechanics

**Core Mechanics:**
- First-person camera control
- WASD movement (full movement within the defensive area)
- Mouse look (to scan the environment and aim)
- Primary fire (left mouse button)
- Reloading (automatic or manual with 'R' key)

**Design Philosophy:** 
The player mechanics will be intentionally simple and focused, staying true to the arcade roots of Space Invaders while adapting to 3D space. The emphasis is on positioning, aiming, and timing rather than complex movement abilities or power management.

**Movement System:**
- Moderate complexity with full 360° movement within a confined area
- WASD keys for forward, backward, and strafing left/right
- Strafing is essential for dodging incoming projectiles
- Player is confined to a defined defensive area/platform with invisible boundaries
- No jumping or vertical movement (keeps focus on the horizontal plane)
- Movement speed is consistent (no sprinting or crouching)
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration for responsive but not twitchy control
- Slight camera bob during movement for visual feedback

**Movement Constraints:**
- Clearly defined boundaries marked by visual indicators (force fields, barriers, etc.)
- Collision detection with environment objects within the play area
- Subtle "push back" effect when reaching boundaries rather than hard stops
- Small defensive structures within the play area can provide partial cover

**Weapon Handling:**
- Simple point-and-shoot mechanics
- Weapon upgrades affect performance but not core handling
- Reloading creates strategic pauses in combat
- Visual and audio feedback for successful hits

**Shield System:**
- Shields are automatically activated when acquired
- No manual activation required
- Visual indicator shows shield health/status
- Audio cue when shields are damaged or destroyed

**Ability Progression System:**
- Temporary upgrades only - all enhancements reset on game over
- True to arcade roots where each game session starts fresh
- Upgrades are collected during gameplay by defeating specific enemies
- Progressive stacking of upgrades within a single session
- No permanent progression between game sessions
- Encourages mastery of the core gameplay rather than grinding for permanent upgrades

**Temporary Upgrade Types:**
- Weapon enhancements (damage, fire rate, spread, ammo capacity)
- Shield improvements (durability, regeneration)
- Movement speed boosts
- Special ammo types (explosive rounds, penetrating shots)
- Temporary power-ups (brief invincibility, rapid fire)

**Questions to clarify:**
- ✓ What player abilities should be included beyond basic movement and shooting?
- ✓ Should there be a progression system for player abilities?
- ✓ How complex should the movement mechanics be?
